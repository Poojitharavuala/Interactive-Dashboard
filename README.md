# Interactive-Dashboard
Excel has several sheets of different data. It is difficult to view data in different sheets at a single time. 
So, i have created a Interactive Dashboard
Dashboards are essential for distilling complex data into visual, easily understandable insights. They centralize information, track performance, and enable real-time monitoring. Dashboards aid decision-making, promote transparency, and foster efficient communication by presenting data in a standardized format. Their interactive nature allows for data exploration, while customization tailors insights to different users. Ultimately, dashboards enhance strategic planning, facilitate issue detection, and align teams toward common goals, making them invaluable tools for effective management and informed decision-making.
